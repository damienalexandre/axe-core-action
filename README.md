Automated, developer-friendly WCAG 2.1 & 2.2 AA accessibility audit GitHub Action powered by `@axe-core/cli`.

Built and maintained by **Syntropy Digital**.

## Features

- **Workflow Annotations:** Every violation becomes a GitHub error/warning annotation with its CSS selector and axe's failure summary, visible in the run log and the Checks tab.
- **Rich Job Summaries:** Automatically generates clean Markdown tables in the GitHub Actions Step Summary.
- **Configurable Severity Gates:** Fail CI on `critical`, `serious`, or `moderate` issues, or run non-blocking for reporting.
- **Zero Configuration:** Pre-configured with sensible defaults for fast CI runs.

## Services

Automated checks are the floor, not the audit. If you want the manual half — keyboard flows, screen-reader checks, and code-level fixes for the failures this action reports — Syntropy Digital does that work: email **privateeffectivetools@gmail.com** with the repository or URL and the standard you need to meet.
